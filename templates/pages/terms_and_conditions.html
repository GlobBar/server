GlobBar allows users to contribute different kinds of content, including surveys, photos, videos, private messages, and more. Playing nice isn’t rocket science, but just in case, we’ve put together these general guidelines. Please also read the guidelines below for specific types of content that you might contribute to the site.

Inappropriate content: Colorful language and imagery is fine, but there's no need for threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry.
Promotional content: Unless you're owners, managers, or other types of employees of venues covered by GlobBar, and unless you’re participating promotional events sponsored by GlobBar, we generally frown upon promotional content. Let's keep the site useful for consumers and not overrun with commercial noise from every user.
Privacy: Don’t publicize other people’s private information. Please don’t post close-up photos or videos of other patrons without their permission, and please don’t post other people’s full names unless you’re referring to service providers who are commonly identified by or commonly share their own full names.
Intellectual property: Don’t swipe content from other sites or users. You’re a smart cookie, so take your own photos and videos, please!
